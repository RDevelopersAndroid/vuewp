[![VueWP DEMO](https://s23.postimg.org/xie7cj9rv/vimeo_thumb.png)](https://vimeo.com/204961514 "See small VueWP Demo")

## Source Code

VueJS Source code is placed under `public/app/themes/vuewp/app/`

## Install Tools & Download the Source

1. Download and install the current Version of **Composer** from [Getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/)
2. Install global instance of **Gulp** with `npm install -g gulp`
3. Download the Source in your preferred folder with `git clone https://github.com/bedakb/vuewp.git`

## Required Plugins

1. [WordPress REST API v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/)
2. [Better REST API Featured Images](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-rest-api-featured-images/)

## How to configure

- Create new Database that would be reserved for WordPress
- Open `.env` file and enter your database connection info data
- Open the Folder with the source code in your `cmd` and run following commands:
- `composer install` to install wordpress core-files and PHP devDependencies
- `npm install` to install the Node development tools (Scss, BrowserSync, dev-server etc.)
- Activate/install required Plugins
- Make sure you are using pretty permalinks, otherwise WP REST API v2 will not work

## Start Development-Server

Start the development server by simply typing this command: `gulp serve`. A new Chrome window will open a local development server for you to work on.

You can also access this URL in any other browser for testing: http://localhost:8080 or http://XXX.XXX.XX.XX:8080 (insert your LAN IP) to access it from your phone or other device.
